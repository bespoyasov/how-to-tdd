# TTT-TDD

> [In Russian](../README.md)

Test-driven development, TDD is the practice of software development in which programmers first write tests for new functionality, then write an implementation of this functionality, and then refactor code.

The main idea of TDD is to break large tasks into small ones. This method allows you to write more structured, robust and readable code.

This book offers an example of developing a tic-tac-toe game using TDD methodology (hence TTT-TDD :â€“) In it, we'll break down the basics and benefits of the approach, and consider how to use TDD for continuous development in the face of changing business requirements.
